# 개인적으로 추가 정리/확인/공부 할 내용

## [논문 리뷰: Towards Real-Time Multi-Object Tracking](https://junhyungkang.github.io/papers/Towards_Real-Time_Multi-Object_Tracking/)
* 실험에서 비교한 QAN embedding 방법 (Yu, Fengwei, et al. "Poi: Multiple object tracking with high performance detection and appearance feature." European Conference on Computer Vision. Springer, Cham, 2016.)
* auto loss balancing에서 사용한 task-dependent uncertainty 관련 (Kendall, Alex, Yarin Gal, and Roberto Cipolla. "Multi-task learning using uncertainty to weigh losses for scene geometry and semantics." Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2018.)
* CLEAR metrics (Bernardin, Keni, and Rainer Stiefelhagen. "Evaluating multiple object tracking performance: the clear mot metrics." EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing 2008 (2008): 1-10.)
* smooth upper bound of the triplet loss (Sohn, Kihyuk. "Improved deep metric learning with multi-class n-pair loss objective." Advances in neural information processing systems 29 (2016).)
* speculate: 1) form a theory or conjecture about a subject without firm evidence. 2)  invest in stocks, property, or other ventures in the hope of gain but with the risk of loss.
* SORT algorithm (Bewley, Alex, et al. "Simple online and realtime tracking." 2016 IEEE international conference on image processing (ICIP). IEEE, 2016.)
